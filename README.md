# tindog-bootstrapwebpage
This is a project from Angela Yu's Web Development 2021 Bootcamp using Bootstrap 4 in the modules "Introduction to Bootstrap" & "Intermediate Bootstrap". 
In this module I learned to build a website using Bootstrap & more complicated CSS rules. I learned about making a carousel with Bootstrap 4, refactoring code, Z-index, making more responsive websites & did my first wireframe.
